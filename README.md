# Stocks-Analysis
Analysis of green stocks (DQ) (week 2 homework=VBA challenge)
##overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve analyse two years of stock returns, 2017 and 2018. We also refactored code and learned VBA. the goal of the given code for this assingment was to increase the efficiency of the code by a process known as refactoring. 
###Data analysis
We analyzed 12 tickers by year. Each time you run the code, you can choose to analyze either 2017 or 2018. Below are images of each respective years returns
