# Stocks-Analysis
Analysis of green stocks (DQ) (week 2 homework=VBA challenge)
##overview
The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve analyse two years of stock returns, 2017 and 2018. We also refactored code and learned VBA. the goal of the given code for this assingment was to increase the efficiency of the code by a process known as refactoring. 
###Data analysis
We analyzed 12 tickers by year. Each time you run the code, you can choose to analyze either 2017 or 2018. Below are images of each respective years returns

Based on these imagines, you can see that the 2017 year had more positive returns.

2018 was a faster code time. 

##SUMMARY 
Refactoring our code makes it much easier to read and understand for the user and any future users. it also makes the code run faster. this can lead to easier improvements in the future if the data gets bigger or more complex. Some of the cons are that refactoring can be complex and time consuming and can have little marginal beneftis in terms of time savings, especially if the code is going to do the same thing in a slightly faster manner for hours and hours of cleaning. It is an easy fix for this project, but refactoring in larger projects could become a very tedious and needless task. There is a very fine balance between making something work and having it be clean and being tedious and meticulous about code.
